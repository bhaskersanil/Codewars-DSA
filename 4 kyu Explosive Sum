How many ways can you make the sum of a number?
From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)

In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition. If order matters, the sum becomes a composition. For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1


function partition(n) {
    let p = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    p[0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j <= n; j++) {
            p[j] += p[j - i];
        }
    }

    return p[n];
}
